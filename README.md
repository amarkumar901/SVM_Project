# SVM_Project

This dataset is a medical dataset taken from the sklearn library. 
In this we need to classify that a given person is Malignant or Benign.

I have used SVM algorithm to classify the dataset. While used grid search to find the best combination of hyper parameter and came up with quite good result.
